Project Description: Personal Finance Tracker (Streamlit App)
This Personal Finance Tracker is a web application built using Streamlit and Pandas, designed to help users track their recurring expenses, calculate total costs over specific time periods, and get reminders for upcoming payments.

The app provides a simple, interactive, and visually appealing way for users to manage their finances with ease.

Features:
✅ Add Expenses: Users can input expenses with details like name, amount, due date, and payment frequency (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).
✅ Expense Tracking: Displays all entered expenses in a structured table format.
✅ Total Expense Calculation: Computes the total amount due for a selected period (Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly).
✅ Upcoming Payment Reminders: Lists expenses with due dates in the future to help users stay on top of their financial obligations.
✅ Custom Styling: Uses HTML/CSS for a clean and modern UI experience.

Technologies Used:
Streamlit: For building an interactive web interface.
Pandas: For handling and displaying expense data.
Datetime Module: For managing due dates, recurring payments, and upcoming reminders.
How It Works:
Add a New Expense: Users enter expense details and click “Add Expense” to save.
View All Expenses: The app displays a structured table of all entered expenses.
Calculate Totals: Users select a period (Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly), and the app calculates the total expenses for that duration.
Upcoming Payments: The app lists expenses that are due in the future, ensuring users never miss a payment.
Use Cases:
Personal finance management
Tracking recurring subscriptions & bills
Budget planning
Reminder for upcoming payments
This project is a great addition to my portfolio, showcasing my skills in Python, Streamlit, and data handling with Pandas
